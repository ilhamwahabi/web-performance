# BAD FOUND

---

> Aberdeen Group found that a **1s slow down** resulted **11% fewer page views**, **7% less conversion**

---

> Akamai found that **2s delay** in web page load time increase **bounce rates by 103%**

---

> Google found that a **2% slower page** resulted in **2% fewer searches**, which means 2% fewer ads show

---

# GOOD FOUND

---

> A **400ms improvement** in performance resulted in a **9% increase in traffic** at Yahoo

---

> **100ms improvement** in performance results in **1% increase in overall revenue** at Amazon

# Steve Golden Rules of Performance

---

## Doing less stuff takes less time

---

## If you can do it later. Do it later

---

# Javascript Performance

---

## Debugging with worsen performance

<Image alt="" src={require("./images/network.png")} />

---

# Load Performance

---

## Code splitting

---

## Imagine this scenario

<Steps>

1. Your website have home page, about page, and register page
2. User visit your home page
3. Is user also need to load your about page & register page?

</Steps>

---

### Just load what important

<Image alt="" src={require("./images/codesplitting.png")} />

---

## 2 types:

<Steps>

1. Route based
   - Split route that likely will not visited often
   - Ex: Split login page and dashboard page
2. Component based
   - Split component that will not use immediately
   - Ex: Split modal and drawer

</Steps>

---

```js
// load even if user will not use
import Modal from "./Modal.vue";

// just load when used
const Modal = () => import("./Modal.vue");
```

---

### Nuxt use route-based code splitting as default

## Debugging with slow connection

## Things not discussed here

- Animate CSS with performance
- Load font effectively
- Caching
- Service Worker
- Unused code removal
- Much more...
